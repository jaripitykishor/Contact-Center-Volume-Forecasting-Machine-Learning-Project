# Contact-Center-Volume-Forecasting-Machine-Learning-Project
Time series forecasting of contact center call volumes using Python with decomposition, trend/seasonality analysis, and scenario-based modeling.
# Contact Center Volume Forecasting ‚Äì Machine Learning Project

This project is designed to forecast contact center call volumes using machine learning techniques in Python. It simulates realistic call center data and builds time series models to predict future volumes, aiding in workforce management and planning.

## üîç Objective

To develop an end-to-end forecasting system that:

- Simulates contact center call volumes with trends, seasonality, and external business events.
- Performs exploratory data analysis and time series decomposition.
- Builds multiple forecasting models and compares performance.
- Incorporates business scenarios for event-driven forecasting.

## üß† Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`, `statsmodels`, `sklearn`
- **Models:** Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters), ARIMA, Moving Average

## üìä Key Features

- Built a realistic time series dataset representing 2 years of daily call volume.
- Applied decomposition techniques to understand trend, seasonality, and residuals.
- Trained and evaluated ARIMA, Holt-Winters, and Moving Average models.
- Implemented scenario forecasting for events like promotions and outages.
- Compared models using MAE and RMSE to select the most accurate approach.
